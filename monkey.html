                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most simian mammals of infraorder Simiiformes.
         Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except
          the apes; in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes may also be included, making the
           terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard of their scope. Monkeys are divided into the
            families of New World monkeys and Old World monkeys (which again include apes in the broader
             sense as parvorder Catarrhini, but not in the stricter sense as family Cercopithecidae).</p>
     <p>Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily
          on the ground, such as baboons. Most species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys
           are generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World monkeys.</p>
     <P>Simians and tarsiers emerged within haplorrhines some 60 million years ago. New World 
         monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the simians some 35 million years ago. 
         Old World monkeys and Hominoidea emerged within the catarrhine monkeys some 25 million years ago. 
         Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus [35â€“32 million years ago] are also
          considered monkeys by primatologists.</P>
